# Simple HTML/CSS Personal Blog

A simple, responsive blog using CSS and HTML.

### File directory

- **blog.html** is the "index" for this site. Navigation is currently functional.
- **bio.htm** is the second page for this site. Has some basic information about site creator.
- **styles.htm** is the third and final page for this site. Shows off the design system that goes into play for this blog.

CSS and blog relevant images have been put in their own folders for maximum optimisation.

- **primary.css** controls the basic bones of the site and carries through most heavily for each page.
- **secondary.css** technically lines up with the author bio page but has some overlap into the next stylesheet.
- **typography.css** is used with the blog style page and leans a bit on the framework set up by the above stylesheet.
- **media-flex.css** has all of the media query arguments, and while these are simple now, I'd like to continue this practice in case it gets more complicated in the future.

### Developer thoughts 

If I were to attempt something like this again, I would like to have a more seamless/complemetary design system where I don't have to override certain elements as much. Giving important ids and classes to specific elements (like h2) would not only make something like this simple but avoid a CSS import overlap in the future. Sometimes, it can't be helped, especially with smaller elements, but having to go back to override or rename things to prevent an override is a problem that can be corrected from the start. Just things to be more mindful of! :sparkles:
